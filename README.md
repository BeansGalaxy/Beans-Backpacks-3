# WIP ~ALPHA~ (BETA) VERSION

This mod is still an early preview of the overhauled mechanics from the original Bean's Backpacks.

Check out the wiki for how this version of the mod works. https://github.com/BeansGalaxy/Beans-Backpacks-3/wiki

## Dev Update 2/25/2025

Recently I've gotten a new job that allows me to travel, I've been afk from my desktop at home for about a month now which means I haven't been able to continue progress on the mod. I plan to be home in another 2 months, and once I get back, I plan to knock down these bug reports and release a full version of the mod. 

Thanks for the ongoing support, we will return shortly.

## Dev Update 5/18/2025

I've just moved to a new state and I've gotten my computer set back up! I've been very busy settling in, but I've been looking back through my code and I'm hoping to begin progress with this mod once again with the free time I can find. It'll be some time before the next update, the bug tracker looks like it piled up a bit. I hope to get the next update with these solutions out in a month so I can start wrapping up these features and fully release this mod. For the time being the mod will continue to be develpoed in 1.21.1.

Thanks for the ongoing support, see above.

## Dev Update 7/13/2025

Shortly is relative right? I've been making big changes to the mod as it stands in Beta-0.8. Before the next update I plan to seperate the Shorthand, Utility Slot, and the Backpacks Experiments Feature into unique mods.

### Beans' Backpacks Experiments Add-on

This will be a playground for me to test new features before adding them to the main mod. I'm happy with the current implementation being included with the full mod but it's created a lot of bloat with many unfinished features I dont plan to get back to. 

### Beans' Backpacks Utilities Add-on

Utilities are a cool way to tie in this mod with other useful features from vanilla/other mods. But after playing using the mod I rarely find myself using it which I assume many other players dont use it either... The code for the Utilities is a bunch of spaghetti so to clean up the focused features and make the mod lighter it'll be an add-on.

### Beans' Toolbelt (Stand-Alone Mod)

Just finished seperating the Shorthand into it's own standalone mod. I've updated a few controls that I find more intuitive and simpler than what's present in Beta-0.8 and I hope you agree. I've submitted the mod for review but it seems like Modrinth is currently going through some growing pains. I perfer Modrinth over CurseForge cuz the genuine effort they put into pushing the Minecraft community. It's like $6/mo for Modrinth+ which is less than a 2 cheeseburger meal from McDonalds. If you think what they are pushing with Server and Mod hosting is more important than 2 burgers, a drink, and fries then go support them!!
