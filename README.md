## Dev Update 2/25/2025

Recently I've gotten a new job that allows me to travel, I've been afk from my desktop at home for about a month now which means I haven't been able to continue progress on the mod. I plan to be home in another 2 months, and once I get back, I plan to knock down these bug reports and release a full version of the mod. 

Thanks for the ongoing support, we will return shortly.

## Dev Update 5/18/2025

I've just moved to a new state and I've gotten my computer set back up! I've been very busy settling in, but I've been looking back through my code and I'm hoping to begin progress with this mod once again with the free time I can find. It'll be some time before the next update, the bug tracker looks like it piled up a bit. I hope to get the next update with these solutions out in a month so I can start wrapping up these features and fully release this mod. For the time being the mod will continue to be develpoed in 1.21.1.

Thanks for the ongoing support, see above.
